<p>A type of card that represents the place or location where the battle is taking place.</p>
<p>A Place card may represent a very specific place, like a <a href="/concepts/Venue">Venue</a> or a <a href="/concepts/Facility">Facility</a>, or a general type of place.</p>
<p>Some places reside within others. The Battlefield can "move" from a parent place to a child place and vice versa. (This is the idea that a monster battle can move from one place to another without ending or being interrupted.) However, the Battlefield cannot "move" from a child place to a place that is not its parent.</p>
<p>A parent Place card can come onto the Battlefield while its child card is on the Battlefield and vice versa. Put the parent card underneath the child card so that its name remains visible.</p>
