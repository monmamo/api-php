<p>An intangible or behavioral attribute of an anthrope or monster.</p>
<h2>Use of Traits in the <a href="/cards">Card System</a></h2>
<p>A Trait card can be attached to a Monster card only when a Monster card comes into the Battlefield. If a game has a <a href="/cg/rules#setup">Setup phase</a> in which Monsters can come onto the Battlefield, a Trait card can be attached to a Monster card at any time during the Setup Phase. Otherwise, a Trait card can be attached to a Monster card only when the Monster card comes onto the <a href="/cg/rules#game-layout-battlefield">Battlefield</a> from the hand, Library or Discard.</p>
<p>Once a Trait card is attached to another card, it is considered to be part of the card. As long as the Monster card is on the Battlefield, the Trait card remains attached to it. If the Monster card is removed from the Battlefield, all Trait cards attached to it go to the Discard pile.</p>
<p>If a Trait card has an effect that can be applied “once per turn,” it can be applied during the Resolution Phase of any players’ turn.</p>
