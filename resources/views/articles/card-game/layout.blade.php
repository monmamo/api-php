    <h1>Game Layout</h1>
<h2>The Battlefield</h2>
<p>The Battlefield is the main area in which the game and its actions take place. </p>
<p>Players should sit facing each other with a large flat playing surface between them to serve as the Battlefield. A space about 3 feet square will allow plenty of room to place and manipulate cards.</p>
<h2>Library</h2>
<p>The Library is the unused portion of a deck. It remains face down in front of the player or next to the Battlefield until a rule or card text allows the player to look through it. </p>
<p>Place the common Library on one side of the Battlefield. </p>
<p>The Library should be thoroughly shuffled any time someone looks through it.</p>
<h2>Discard</h2>
<p>The Discard pile consists of the cards that are discarded during the course of play.</p>
<p>When discarding a card to the Discard pile, a player may place the card anywhere in the pile: at the top, at the bottom, or on any random position in between (without looking through the pile).</p>
<p>The Discard pile remains face-up during the course of gameplay.</p>
<p>A player may not look through, shuffle or rearrange the Discard pile unless and only when a rule or card text allows him to do so.</p>
<p>Make the Discard pile to the right of the Library.</p>
<h2>Exile</h2>
<p>The Exile zone also consists of the cards that are discarded during the course of play. However, cards moved to the Exile zone are considered removed from the game. They cannot be retrieved at any time or by any means during gameplay.</p>
<p>Cards in the Exile zone remain face-up during the course of gameplay. A player may stack the cards, but must reveal the card completely if any player invokes the card being in Exile.</p>
<p>Make the Exile pile to the left of the Library.</p>
