            <p class="lead mb-4">Monsters Masters &amp; Mobsters is a speculative fiction concept that incorporates elements of magical realism, professional sports and organized (and disorganized) crime. The world of Monsters Masters &amp; Mobsters is our world, but instead of humans there are two types of higher beings: monsters and anthropes. Monsters Masters &amp; Mobsters represents the belief in the power of imagination and the importance of storytelling. We value creativity, originality, and the ability of fantasy and speculative fiction to inspire, entertain, and bring people together.</p>

            <h4 class="display-5 fw-bold text-body-emphasis lh-1 mb-3">This sounds like Pokémon. How is it different?</h4>
            <p class="lead mb-4">Pokémon is Monsters Masters &amp; Mobsters for children.</p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">The concept is simple: Trainable monsters and a culture of training and battling them. Pokémon takes that concept, constrains it in age appropriateness, and applies a simple formula: Anyone can be a Pokémon trainer, and anyone can become the Best Pokémon Master Ever. Monsters Masters &amp; Mobsters is about the concept, not a kid-friendly scoping of the concept. </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">Also, whereas Pokémon and many of the concepts inspired by it come from Japan and are shaped largely by Japanese culture, Monsters Masters &amp; Mobsters is a uniquely American product. Our primary sources of inspiration come from the United States and its many peoples, lands and history.</p>          </div>
