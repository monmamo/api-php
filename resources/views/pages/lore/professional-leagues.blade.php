    <p>The professional leagues operate on the concept of promotion and relegation. The top performing trainers at each level are promoted to the next higher level, while the worst-performing trainers are relegated to the lower level.</p>
    <h2 id="elite-league">Elite League</h2>
    <p>The <organization>Monster Sports Federation</organization> classifies Elite Trainers in a series of tiers, each identified by Medals. The metal levels, from lowest to highest, are thus: Copper, Aluminum, Nickel, Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Titanium. Trainers enter the Elite League in the lowest level. </p>
    <p>Trainers participate in official League competitions (Challenge, Battle or Race) throughout the season. Most of a trainer&#39;s competition will be against a trainer on the same level, though a trainer may compete with someone up to two levels above or below him. </p>
    <p>The performance of a Trainer is measured with //victory points//. A Trainer starts his career with zero victory points. He carries these with him through his career; they are not reset at the end of the season. Trainers accumulate victory points by winning competitions. Victory points are awarded or taken away as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>For defeating a trainer below one&#39;s level or at one&#39;s level or one level above: one point.</li>
    <li>For defeating a trainer two levels above: two points. </li>
    <li>For losing to a trainer at or above one&#39;s level or one level below: no points.</li>
    <li>For losing to a trainer two levels below: one point is deducted.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Elite League season begins in the second month of the year and runs through the 11th month, for a total of 10 months. At the end of each month, all trainers are evenly distributed among the medal-levels according to victory point totals. The trainers with the most points go into the Titanium Tier, the next set go into the Platinum Tier, and so on.</p>
    <p>Each month, trainers in the Titanium and Platinum tiers are invited to participate in //Champion Tournaments//. These tournaments are single-elimination one-on-one competitions. The ultimate winner of each tournament receives an invitation to join the Champion League in the following season. The winner of a Champion Tournament may not participate in any other Champion Tournaments at the Elite League level.</p>
    <p>At the end of the season, a final redistribution takes place. Trainers who are moving on to the Champion League are removed from the pool, and the pool is distributed. The rank that the trainers hold is what they will hold during the first month of the next season. Trainers who are coming into the league will be unranked during the first month of competition, then will be seeded at the end of the first month.</p>
    <h2 id="champion-league">Champion League</h2>
    <p>The Champion League operates in a manner very similar to the Elite League, but with a much smaller pool of Trainers. The tiers of the Champion League are named for gemstones. Trainers accumulate victory points in the same way, though the points for Champion League are kept separate from those in the Elite League.</p>
    <p>At the end of the year, the Champion Trainers compete in the //Diamond Tournament//, a head-to-head double-elimination tournament. The trainers who lose their first two (and thus only) matches are demoted back to the Elite League.</p>
