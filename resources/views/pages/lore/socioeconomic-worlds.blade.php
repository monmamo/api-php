<h1>The Socioeconomic Environments of the World of Monsters Masters & Mobsters</h1>
<h2>The First World</h2>

    <p>The First World is driven by the needs of the highest levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs: Esteem; knowledge and understanding; aesthetic; and self-actualization.</p>
    <p>This world is very wealthy. The people of this world run the government, the economy and markets, and the corporate systems. They run the media and the best-known, most authoritative people on television live in this world. They also run the academic world, including the most prestigious universities and research organizations.</p>
    <p>This world lives in the major corporate and governmental hubs of the world. In our real world, examples of such cities include Manhattan, Tokyo, London, and Dubai. It also includes technological hubs such as Silicon Valley and seats of government such as the District of Columbia.</p>
    <p>The culture of this world is one of image and polish. It enacts and reinforces standards of dress and image.</p>
    <p>This world has very few wild monsters. The monsters that are present in this world are either pets or are in service to anthropes. Many live in the world of sports and entertainment. Some monsters live in the service of government, including enforcing the peace and forensics. Virtually nobody in this world trains monsters as a pastime.</p>


<h2>The Second World</h2>
<p>The Second World is what is largely considered "middle class" or "working class" in the United States. The culture of this world is one of working for a living, enjoying life in spite of its toils and hardships, and supporting one's family and community. In terms of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, it is driven by safety, security, love, acceptance and belonging.</p>
<p>This world is moderately wealthy. Its people enjoy peace, safety and a general sense of security. They live in cities or towns. They have homes, plenty of food, adequate dress, and just enough disposable income for nonessential items and activities. They work most of the week and play on the weekends. They consider wealth to be generational in nature. For example, homes and businesses are usually inherited from parents to children.</p>
<p>This world has plenty of monsters. Many people and families have one or more monsters as pets. Monsters are widely used in industry and farming. Many people train monsters for some reason (productivity, security, sport, etc.), and monsters sports is a popular pastime.</p>

<h2>The Third World</h2>

<p>The Third World is everything and everyone outside First and Second World.</p>
<p>This world is driven by the lowest levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. It has little wealth, safety or stability. It is rife with crime and exploitation. As a result, the people who live in this world are hardened and cynical. They are often distrustful of outsiders, and they have little interest in the world beyond their immediate survival.</p>
<p>People in this world tend to live in societal structures such as tribes, clans and gangs. Many of these people live in the vast lands that are foreign to people of the First and Second World: the jungles, the deserts, the swamps, etc. Often, the choice of where one lives is driven by where one's family has always lived. Many live in villages buried deep in their native lands, where they derive security from familiarity with the land.</p>
<p>Those who live in urbanized areas tend to be sole survivalists. They take whatever odd jobs they can land. They frequently join gangs.</p>
<p>This world has large numbers of monsters, most of which are wild. Some monsters are domesticated, but they are rarely treated as pets. It is not uncommon for people who live in this world to have a monster companion, but these companions are often more like tools or weapons than friends. Also, they know the monsters of their native areas very well, and they are often able to use them to their advantage in survival situations.</p>
<p>The people of the Third World are often very resourceful, using whatever they can find to survive. They are skilled in crafting and repairing tools, weapons, and shelters from available materials. Their clothing is often practical and durable, made from local resources that can withstand harsh conditions.</p>
