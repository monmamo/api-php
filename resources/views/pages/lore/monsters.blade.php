<h1>Monsters</h1>

<p>Monsters are animals with great genetic and biological diversity. Monsters do not have a set taxonomy but bear intangible Traits and tangible Features that are of genetic significance.</p>

<p>Monsters are male, female or neutral. (There are no gender-ambiguous, gender-fluid or hermaphroditic Monsters.)</p>

<p>Monsters coexist with humans in much the same way that domesticated animals coexist with humans in our world.</p>

<p>Monsters have some degree of sentience but generally do not have free will. A Monster born into captivity will obey humans according to the training that it receives. A Monster born into the wild requires a substantial amount of training before it will comply with human commands, but it is still trainable.</p>

<p>The relationship that a particular Monster has with a particular human is quantified as Respect.</p>

<p>The domestication of Monsters has bred a culture in which many people have a Monster as a pet. Many individuals take a Monster as a pet at an early age, and the Monster remains loyal to its "owner" through its life.</p>

<p>As the domestication of Monsters evolved, it led to the rise of breeding and training Monsters for sport. Monsters are very competitive and love participating in challenges, battles and races.</p>

<p>Monsters are keen on developing relationships with other Monsters and working with them in battle. The stronger the relationship between two Monsters on the same side in a Competition, the more likely they are to work in unison. By contrast, if two Monsters with a strong relationship are forced to attack each other, they will resist.</p>

<p>The origin of Monsters will be left as an exercise to the fans.</p>
