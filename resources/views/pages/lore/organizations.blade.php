<h1>Organizations</h1>

<p>Organizations in the Monsters Masters & Mobsters universe play a crucial role in shaping the interactions between humans and monsters. These groups can range from formal institutions to informal collectives, each with its own goals, values, and methods.</p>

<p>Some organizations focus on the protection and rights of monsters, advocating for their fair treatment and integration into society. Others may be more focused on the control and regulation of monsters, seeking to manage their presence and influence. There are also organizations that operate in the shadows, engaging in illicit activities involving monsters for profit or power.</p>
