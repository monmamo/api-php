<h2>Rules for Ask Us Anything</h2>


<ol>
<li>You must ask a specific question.</li>

<li>Your question must be directed at one or more specific people who are considered "staff"&mdash;administrators, moderators, paid staff, etc.</li>

<li>Tag the person you are asking with the proper "@" tag, to ensure they see your question and answer it in a timely manner.</li>

<li>Off-topic banter is not allowed. You may respond or ask follow-up questions, but you must stay on topic.</li>

<li>Ask one question at a time. Wait for your pending question to be answered before asking another. If the person you want to ask already has an unanswered question targeted at them, please wait until that question is answered before posting your own.</li>

<li>Be patient. We're on United States time. Depending on when you ask, the person you are asking may be asleep, at a day job or otherwise unable to respond.</li>

<li>Staff have the right to refuse to answer any question.</li>

<li>Use Discord threads to keep content for separate questions separate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Post elsewhere if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don't have a direct question.</li>
<li>Your question is to "everyone" or to non-staff participants.</li>
<li>You just don't want to follow these rules.</li>
<li>If it pertains to Monsters Masters & Mobsters, put it in #general. If it does not, put it in #random.</li>
</ul>
