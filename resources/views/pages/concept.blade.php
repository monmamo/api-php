<p class="lead mb-4">Monsters Masters &amp; Mobsters is a speculative fiction concept that incorporates elements of magical realism, professional sports and organized (and disorganized) crime. The world of Monsters Masters &amp; Mobsters is our world, but instead of humans there are two types of higher beings: monsters and anthropes. Monsters Masters &amp; Mobsters represents the belief in the power of imagination and the importance of storytelling. We value creativity, originality, and the ability of fantasy and speculative fiction to inspire, entertain, and bring people together.</p>

    <p>The core concept of Monsters Masters & Mobsters is an alternate Earth populated by two types of beings: <a href="/concepts/Anthrope">Anthropes</a> and <a href="/concepts/Monster">Monsters</a>. Anthropes are humanlike beings with high sentience, and the Monsters are animals of lower sentience. All Anthropes and Monsters are mammals.</p>
