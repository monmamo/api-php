    <h1>Tabletop Roleplaying Game</h1>

<p>IN DEVELOPMENT</p>

@env('local')
<h2>Core Mechanics</h2>

Create the fundamental rules and systems that will drive gameplay:

- Character creation and progression
- Task resolution (e.g. dice rolls, cards, etc.)
- Combat and conflict resolution  
- Magic/special abilities (if applicable)

Focus on mechanics that reinforce your core concept and desired player experience. Keep things simple at first - you can always add complexity later.

## Design Character Options

Develop the choices players will have for creating their characters:

- Classes/archetypes
- Skills and abilities  
- Equipment and resources
- Character advancement

Ensure options are balanced and support diverse playstyles.

## Create the Setting

Flesh out the world your game takes place in:

- Geography and locations
- Cultures and factions
- History and lore
- Creatures and antagonists

Provide enough detail to inspire players and GMs, while leaving room for customization.

## Write the Rules

Compile all your mechanics, character options, setting information, and gameplay procedures into a comprehensive rulebook. Focus on clarity, organization, and ease of reference during play.

## Playtest Extensively  

Run multiple playtests with different groups to identify issues and refine the gameplay experience. Be open to feedback and willing to make major changes if needed[1][2].

## Design Layout and Art

Create an appealing visual presentation for your game materials. Consider commissioning artwork to bring your world to life[3].

## Publish and Distribute

Decide how you want to release your game - print, PDF, or both. Look into print-on-demand services or crowdfunding to cover production costs[3].

Remember, game design is an iterative process. Be prepared to revise and refine your ideas multiple times as you develop your RPG. Most importantly, create a game you're passionate about and would love to play yourself.
