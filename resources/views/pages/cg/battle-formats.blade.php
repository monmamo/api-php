<h1>Battle Format and Objective</h1>
        
<p>The Card Game supports multiple ways of playing the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players can compete as individuals or as teams.</li>
<li>Players can set the objective of the game, such as victory being that a certain numbers of Monsters are knocked out.</li>
<li>Players can set the conditions that need to be met before the battle can begin. For example, if the battle is a three-on-three battle, then each player must have three Monsters on the Battlefield before the battle can officially begin. </li>
