Elements of a Card
Card Name
The Card Name names what the card represents: a Monster, a character, a place, some sort of action, etc. 
All cards with the same Card Name are considered to be the same thing, even if the specific text or any other attribute is different. Different cards (differentiated by Card Number) may have the same Card Name. For example, there are cases where two different cards can have the same Card Name but differing Card Types. 
Cards can represent specific characters or concepts in the Monsters Masters & Mobsters universe (a named Anthrope, a named Monster, a specific place, etc.). In those cases, only one of the card may be on the Battlefield at any particular part in time.
Card type
The Card Type indicates and sets the general function of the card. The Card Type section of this rulebook lists and explains the various Card Types.
Card Text
The Card Text indicates specific information associated with the card, including:
How many of the card may be on the Battlefield at any particular part in time.
Specific rules that apply to the use of that card.
Values of various statistics associated with the card.
Flavor Text
Flavor Text has no effect on the mechanics of the game, but adds lore or characterization to the card.
Card Number
Finally, the Card Number uniquely identifies the card among all cards in the Monsters Masters & Mobsters Card System.  As with Flavor Text, the Card Number has no effect on the mechanics of the game.
Monster Properties
Monster cards have the following statistics:
HP: The highest number of health points that the Monster can have. This number is also called “Damage Capacity” and the points are also called “damage points.”
Level: A number indicating the relative experience of the Monster.
Size: A number indicating the relative size of the Monster.
Speed: A number indicating the relative speed of the Monster.
Biological sex of the monster (male or female).
Taxons: Attributes that determine the core genetic properties of the Monster.
Multiplier: Indicates the number of cards that a Monster can fetch on a Draw phase. Also applies to some skills.
Innate skill, if the Monster has one.
