Setup
battle format and objective
The Card Game supports multiple ways of playing the game:
Players can compete as individuals or as teams.
Players can set the objective of the game, such as victory being that a certain numbers of Monsters are knocked out.
Players can set the conditions that need to be met before the battle can begin. For example, if the battle is a three-on-three battle, then each player must have three Monsters on the Battlefield before the battle can officially begin. 
ðŸ’¡ The default format is a head-to-head battle with an equal number of Monsters on each team. New players should start with one Monster each while familiarizing themselves with the rules and gameplay, and expand play to include two or three Monsters per player as they become more familiar with the game. 
See the Battle Formats section for details on battle formats and special rules.
Draft Monsters
In the Single-Deck Version, the Monsters are outside of the Library because, unless players agree otherwise, only some Monsters will be in the game. 
 Players may decide for themselves how each player will get which Monster. Options include:
Put all Monsters face-up in the Battlefield and draft them, with one player at a time taking a Monster and putting it on your team.
Put the Monsters face-down in the Battlefield and choose them at random.
Once players have their Monsters, take the remaining Monsters and put them away from the Battlefield, such as back in the game box.
PutTING cards Into the Battlefield
The Setup phase proceeds as a series of turns in which each player makes one play per turn. The Setup phase cannot complete until the requirements of the agreed-upon battle format are met.
To determine who gets the first setup turn, each player rolls a die. The player who receives the highest number gets to go first. Play proceeds clockwise from there.
Each player draws a hand of seven cards.
Each player must do one of the following during their turn:
Place a Master, Mobster, Bystander, Drone, or Place card on the Battlefield.
If a Mobster card with the same name as a Bystander card that is already on the Battlefield is put onto the Battlefield, the Bystander card is discarded.
Attach one card of one of the following types to one of your Monster cards already on the Battlefield: Trait, Mana.
For the purposes of effects and restrictions that apply to the card entering the Battlefield, the entire Setup phase counts as one instance of the card entering the Battlefield. (For example, Traits can be attached to Monsters only when the Monster enters the Battlefield, but the entire Setup phase counts as a Monster entering the Battlefield.)
Attach a Proficiency card to a Master, Mobster, Bystander card.
Play a Draw or Vendor card.
Discard any number of cards.
If the requirements of the format have been met, declare your setup complete.
NOTE: A player must play or discard at least one card on each turn during setup.
Regardless of what you do, you must have seven cards in your hand at the end of your turn. If you have fewer than seven cards, draw back up to seven. If you have more than seven cards, discard down to seven.
Completing Setup
Once the requirements of the chosen Battle Format have been met, any player may declare setup complete. All other players will have one final Setup turn.
