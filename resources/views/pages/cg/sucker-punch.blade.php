<h1>Sucker Punch</h1>

<p>When declaring an <a href="/concepts/Attack">Attack</a>, you can declare it as a Sucker Punch. </p>
<p>If the Attack has a base damage, add the Monster’s <a href="/concepts/Speed">Speed</a> to it.</p>
<p>The targeted Monster cannot use a <a href="/concepts/Defense">Defense</a>.</p>
<p>As a penalty, the Attacking Monster cannot attack or use any skills on its player’s next turn. On the Draw phase, put an indicator on it to indicate it cannot be used on that turn. After all effects of the turn are resolved in the Resolution Phase, you may remove the indicator and resume using the Monster as normal.</p>
