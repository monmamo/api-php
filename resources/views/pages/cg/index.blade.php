<h1>{{__('cg')}}</h1>

<p>The {{__('cg')}} takes inspiration from several games before it, but is built from scratch to be easy to learn, easy to play yet infinitely expandable. </p>

<p>The general objective of the game is to defeat your opponent(s) by guiding your monsters in attacks against your opponentsâ€™ monsters.</p>

<p>The {{__('cg')}} can be played with <a href="/cg/pdv">each player having their own deck</a>, as most trading- and collecible-card games are played, or <a href="/cg/sdv">with each player drawing from a single shared deck</a>. The <a href="/cg/sdv">single-deck version</a> allows players to experience the game with a single deck of cards, freeing them from the pressures of constructing a specialized deck and making it perfect for casual play or for those new to the game.</p>
