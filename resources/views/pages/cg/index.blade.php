<h1>Monsters Masters & Mobsters Card Game</h1>

<p>The Monsters Masters & Mobsters Card Game&mdash;just “the Card Game” for short&mdash;is an expandable/extensible card game based on the concept of anthropes (high-sapience beings) battling each other with monsters (low-sapience beings). You probably have played or at least heard of other games with similar concepts. The Card Game takes inspiration from several games before it, but is built from scratch to be easy to learn, easy to play yet infinitely expandable. </p>

<p>The general objective of the game is to defeat your opponent(s) by guiding your monsters in attacks against your opponents’ monsters.</p>

<p>The Monsters Masters & Mobsters Card Game can be played with <a href="/cg/pdv">each player having their own deck</a>, as most trading- and collecible-card games are played, or <a href="/cg/sdv">with each player drawing from a single shared deck</a>. The <a href="/cg/sdv">single-deck version</a> allows players to experience the game with a single deck of cards, freeing them from the pressures of constructing a specialized deck and making it perfect for casual play or for those new to the game.</p>
