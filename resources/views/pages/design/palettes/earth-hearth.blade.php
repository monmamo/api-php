    <h1>Color Scheme: Earth Hearth</h1>

    <p>This is a beautifully grounded and emotionally rich stratum of the __MonMaMo__ setting—the <strong>Second World</strong> is the heartland, the working class, the community-centered middle tier where <strong>effort, tradition, and togetherness</strong> shape the tone of life. It’s a world of safe homes and crowded rec centers, of weekends at monster matches, and cozy-but-worn furniture passed down with love.</p>

<h2>Themes</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Earned comfort.</li>
    <li>Generational warmth.</li>
    <li>Utilitarian beauty.</li>
    <li>Use of monsters as companions, beasts of burden, and instruments of safety and security.</li>
</ul>

<p>This palette is designed to evoke the warmth and comfort of home, while also reflecting the hardworking spirit of the Second World. It draws from:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Natural tones</strong> found in the earth and plant life.</li>
    <li><strong>Domestic warmth</strong> of family and community spaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Faded industrial strength</strong> from the working-class aesthetic.</li>
    <li>Touches of color inspired by <strong>monster care, sport, and blue-collar pride</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thematic Justification</h2>


<p><strong>Warm neutrals and weathered tones</strong> emphasize comfort, repetition, and ritual—home-cooked meals, routine work, and love held over generations.</p>
<p><strong>Citrus Ember</strong> brings energy and joy, reflecting <strong>monsters as companions</strong>, and sport as escape. It's the spark inside the structure.</p>
<p><strong>Suburban Blue</strong> and <strong>Garden Sage</strong> link directly to the <strong>sky and land</strong>, symbols of honest work and a stable home.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Oat</strong> adds subtle optimism—it’s not luxury, but it’s pride.</p>
<p>This is a palette of people who __have enough, love enough, and work hard to hold it all together__.</p>
