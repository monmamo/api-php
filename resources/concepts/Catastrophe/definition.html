<p>
    In the <a href="/cg">Card Game</a>, a type of play that causes a major
    effect on the game.
</p>
<p>
    Only one Catastrophe card may be played during any game. Once it is played,
    the Catastrophe card remains in the center of the
    <a href="/concepts/Battlefield">Battlefield</a> for the rest of the battle
    as a reminder that it was played. (It does not replace any Place cards
    already or subsequently on the Battlefield unless the Catastrophe card
    explicitly prohibits Place cards.) Any Catastrophe cards that are
    subsequently revealed go immediately into
    <a href="/concepts/Exile">Exile</a> and have no effect on play.
</p>
<p>
    A Catastrophe card must be the very first card that a player plays during
    their turn (during the <a href="/cg/draw-phase">Draw phase</a>). Otherwise
    the card has no effect.
