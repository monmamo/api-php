<p>An action that a monster takes against any number of other monsters or anthropes.</p>
<p>A Skill is something that a Monster can do only by being taught and learning how to do it.</p>
<p>A Skill produces one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Causes Damage to one or more Monsters.</li>
<li>Prevents Damage from being done to a Monster (usually self).</li>
<li>Changes a Monster property or condition for the current Turn or future Turns.</li>
<li>Causes a change in the Weather.</li>
<li>Enables the Monster to transport the Trainer (see Movement).</li>
</ul>
<p>A Skill targets a number of Monsters (usually one, perhaps more, sometimes zero) but can potentially affect all Monsters in play.</p>
