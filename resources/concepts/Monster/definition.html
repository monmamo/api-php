<p>Monsters are animals with great genetic and biological diversity. monsters do not have a set taxonomy but bear Breeds, intangible Traits and tangible Features that are of genetic significance.</p>
<p>Monsters are male, female or neutral. (There are no gender-ambiguous, gender-fluid or hermaphroditic Monsters.)</p>
<p>Monsters coexist with anthropes in much the same way that domesticated animals coexist with humans in our world.</p>
<p>Monsters have some degree of sentience but generally do not have free will. A monster born into captivity will obey anthropes according to the training that it receives. A monster born into the wild requires a substantial amount of training before it will comply with human commands, but it is still trainable.</p>
<p>The domestication of monsters has bred a culture in which many people have a Monster as a pet. Many individuals take a monster as a pet at an early age, and the Monster remains loyal to its "owner" or primary trainer through its life.</p>
<p>As the domestication of monsters evolved, it led to the rise of breeding and training monsters for sport. monsters are competitive and love participating in challenges, battles and races.</p>
<p>Monsters are keen on developing relationships with other monsters and working with them in battle. The stronger the relationship between two monsters on the same side in a competition, the more likely they are to work in unison. By contrast, if two monsters with a strong relationship are forced to attack each other, they will resist.</p>
<p>Monsters are not inherently good nor evil. They are neither obedient nor rebellious in nature. Rather, each monster is the product of its training. </p>
<ul>
    <li>A monster that is trained in the ways of good will work for good; a monster that is trained in the ways of evil will work for evil. </li>
    <li>A monster that receives wise and productive training will be a loyal and respectful worker and competitor for its trainer. But a monster that receives ineffective training will disobey and disrespect its trainer.</li>
</ul>
