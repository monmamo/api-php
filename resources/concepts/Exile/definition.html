<p>In the <a href="/cg">Card Game</a>, "exile" refers both to a state of being and a place where cards are put. When a card is exiled, it is removed from the game and placed in a separate zone, inaccessible to players. This mechanic adds a strategic layer to gameplay, allowing players to permanently remove threats or resources from the game.</p>
