// Healers have dreams; this is their greatest gift. Their dreams fuel them, and keep them inspired. They often hear a calling to go forth into the world to help others, and they are ready to make the personal sacrifices involved. They live for their dreams, and seek connections with others who share in their vision. Healers have a profound sense of idealism about who they are and who they hope to become. When they are convinced that their dream must be fulfilled, they believe in it, and they forge head with perseverance.
