// The trademark of Performers is the way they use their charm to get what they want. Even when they are not fully aware of their intent, they use charming tactics to discover what is advantageous. They express their emotions and affections; they cannot hide their feelings unless they specifically try to do so. They cannot help but be charismatic, exuding a warm and cheerful presence. Their charm allows them to be at the center of the action, and to be in the limelight at all times.
