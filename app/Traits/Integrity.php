// Providers seek to conduct themselves with integrity in all interactions with others. For these individuals integrity is about being moral, dependable, beneficent and respectable. They have a strong set of values with clear "should" and "shouldn'ts" which they expect others to abide by. They consistently apply the same rules of consideration across all relationships. They are naturally conscientious and orderly—and make for extremely loyal team players.
